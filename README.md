# glyphcounter

.............\n
..XXXXXX.....\n
..XX..XX.....\n
..XX..XX.....\n
..XXXXXX...XX\n

This python script recursively counts the number of glyphs.  A glyph can be considered as a collection of continuos 1s in this case Xs.
This is a simplified charecter reader. In the above example it will count 2 glyphs.
